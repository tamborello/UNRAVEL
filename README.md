# UNRAVEL
The UNRAVEL project is a computational process model of systematic procedural error in a continuous task, Altmann &amp; Trafton's UNRAVEL task. Based on Tamborello &amp; Trafton's (2013a &amp; b) model of postcompletion, anticipation, and perseveration error in a routine procedural non-continuous task. Developed with ACT-R6 (r1227), boost-chunks module 10 (may be made available upon request), spacing-effect module (ACT-R extras), &amp; new-threads 2.0a (ACT-R extras), &amp; Mike Byrne's misc-lib and seq-math libraries (included for convenience).
